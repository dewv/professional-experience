At the start of each staff meeting, a designated person will:

1. Update the Customer Service commications project board's first column by adding all new Issues with the "Customer service" label.
2. Convene an ops discussion, with all staff, and record decisions/assignments. The group will discuss each Issue on the board and agree on its status (column), next steps, and next customer follow up.
